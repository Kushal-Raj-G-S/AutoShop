Requirement Specification — Auto-parts Marketplace & Vendor Dispatch App
1. Overview
Purpose: Build a lightweight cross-platform (iOS, Android, Windows) mobile app + admin web/desktop console that allows customers to browse and order auto-parts, vendors to accept & dispatch orders, and admin to manage inventory, vendors, payments and analytics. UI/UX should be inspired by Boodmo (clean catalog, parts categories, cart, vendor assignment flows) but not copied.
Primary actors
•
Admin — full platform control (inventory, vendors, orders, payments, dashboard).
•
Customer — browses, orders parts, pays, tracks history, chats with vendor.
•
Vendor — registers store, receives nearby orders, accepts & dispatches, views own history.
•
Payment Gateway / Bank — handles payments to admin’s account.
•
System — notification, geolocation, matching engine, central DB, chat & realtime.
2. High-level Functional Requirements
2.1 Admin (Console / App)
•
FR-A1: Admin can upload inventory items (part name, SKU/part number, brand, category, sub-category, description, images, price, tax, service time / lead time, stock count, unit type: pcs|box|carton).
•
FR-A2: Admin can bulk upload (CSV/XLSX) and bulk edit inventory.
•
FR-A3: Admin can add/modify/delete vendors. Vendor profile includes store name, owner name, contact details, store address, store location coordinates (lat/long), pin code, service areas, bank details (for KYC), status (pending, approved, blocked).
•
FR-A4: Admin can moderate vendor registrations (approve/reject) and add notes/required documents. Only approved vendors are active.
•
FR-A5: Admin can view all customers’ orders and manually assign orders to vendors by proximity, or allow automatic assignment (configurable).

3. Key Business Rules & Workflows
3.1 Order lifecycle (typical)
1.
Customer places order (cart -> checkout -> payment).
2.
System records order and marks it Pending Assignment with geolocation of delivery address.
3.
System finds vendors within radius (configurable) who are active and available.

4.
System pushes real-time order notification to nearby vendors (queue).
5.
First Accept Wins: vendor presses Accept — system applies atomic lock (Redis or DB transaction) to set vendor_id on order. Order removed from other vendor queues.
6.
Vendor dispatches and updates status (Dispatched, Delivered). Customer and admin notified.
7.
Admin can reassign if vendor fails to dispatch within timeline or cancels.
3.2 Vendor Proximity & Assignment Rules
•
Proximity radius configurable (km). Option: prefer vendors with faster average service time or higher rating.
•
If no vendor accepts within X minutes, escalate to admin for manual assignment, or broaden radius.
•
Admin override allowed.
3.3 Payment & Settlement
•
Payments processed via Payment Gateway. Gateway webhooks notify app backend of success/failure.
•
Admin receives payments into platform merchant account. If vendor payouts are required, platform records payable to vendor and triggers periodic payouts (manual or scheduled).
•
Refunds managed in admin console (full or partial). Refund flow must reverse payment with gateway API and mark order refunded.
4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
•
NFR-1 (Cross-Platform): Single codebase preferred. Support iOS, Android, Windows desktop.
•
NFR-2 (Lightweight): App install size minimal and efficient runtime memory usage.
•
NFR-3 (Centralized DB): Single central database (Postgres recommended) hosted in cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP).
•
NFR-4 (Realtime): Real-time features (order push & chat) via WebSocket (socket.io) or Firebase Realtime / FCM for notifications.
•
NFR-5 (Performance): API response < 300ms typical for catalog queries; scale to thousands of daily active users with horizontal scaling.
•
NFR-6 (Availability): 99.9% uptime SLA for core services.

•
NFR-7 (Security): TLS everywhere, secure storage of secrets, PCI-DSS compliance for payment processing (gateway handles card data).
•
NFR-8 (Scalability): Use stateless app servers behind load balancer, autoscaling, CDN for images.
•
NFR-9 (Localization): Support English and regional language(s) (configurable).
•
NFR-10 (Audit): Full audit logs for admin actions.
5. Data Model (Key Entities)
(Provide simple table list — implementors will refine)
•
Users (user_id, phone, name, email, role [customer/vendor/admin], status, created_at)
•
Customers (user_id FK, default_address_id, addresses JSON)
•
Vendors (vendor_id, user_id, store_name, address, lat, long, pin_code, documents[], status, rating, service_areas)
•
Categories (category_id, parent_id, name, slug)
•
Items / Parts (item_id, sku, title, brand, category_id, subcategory_id, description, images[], price, tax, unit_type, stock_count, service_time, compatibility_tags)
•
InventoryLog (id, item_id, vendor_id|null, change_type, quantity, timestamp)
•
Orders (order_id, customer_id, vendor_id|null, status, total_amount, payment_status, shipping_address, created_at, assigned_at, delivered_at)
•
OrderItems (order_item_id, order_id, item_id, qty, unit_price, unit_type)
•
Payments (payment_id, order_id, amount, gateway_txn_id, status, created_at)
•
Chats (chat_id, order_id, from_user_id, to_user_id, message, attachments[], timestamp)
•
Payouts (payout_id, vendor_id, amount, status, scheduled_date)
•
AdminAuditLog (id, admin_id, action, details, timestamp)
6. APIs (Sketch)
Provide REST endpoints (versioned) + WebSocket channels for realtime.
Auth
•
POST /v1/auth/request-otp { phone } → OTP sent
•
POST /v1/auth/verify-otp { phone, otp } → returns JWT

7. Realtime / Concurrency Details (Critical)
•
Use atomic locking when vendor accepts an order (Redis SETNX or DB transaction with WHERE vendor_id IS NULL update). This ensures "first-accept-wins".
•
After assignment, broadcast update to all connected vendors so order is removed.

•
For occasional race conditions, server must check assignment again before confirming to vendor and return appropriate status to losing vendors.
8. Chat & Messaging
•
Lightweight in-app chat per order; messages stored in DB with attachments in object storage.
•
Use WebSocket for immediate delivery, fallback to push notifications.
•
Allow vendor/customer to see chat history only for orders they are part of.

Real-time KPIs: Today’s orders, pending assignments, completed, cancellations, revenue, app downloads (from stores), active vendors & customers.
•
Filters by date range, vendor, category, city/pincode.
•
Inventory alerts (low stock), automatic reorder suggestions.
•
Export transactions / invoices / vendor statements.
11. Security & Compliance
•
OTP verification, strong JWT tokens, refresh tokens with secure storage.
•
All APIs behind TLS. Secure headers (CSP, HSTS).
•
Role-based access control: admin vs vendor vs customer.
•
Input validation and rate limiting to prevent abuse.
•
If storing PII or operating in India, follow local data protection regulations and best practices.
